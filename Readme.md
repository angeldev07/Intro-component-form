## My process
  1. Built HTML 5 document
  2. CSS custom properties
  3. Add JS document and validate the forms.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript vanilla
### What I learned

I learned how to do a simple Form validation with Javascript. 

I had a lot of problems, because I was repeating a lot of code and I didn't like it, but after a  üçî, I had an üí° and I managed to develop.
